### **Purpose**

- Due to the typhoon and the sudden cancellation of classes, this reading list is for you to prepare for the next session. This is about Bootstrap Flex and a little activity to read on it and try a short activity.

### **Goal to Checking**

1. Setting Up Your Project
First, set up your HTML document with Bootstrap included. Use the Bootstrap link and scripts to fully use the bootstrap dependencies.

2. Add five flex items inside the d-flex container.

3. Use justify-content to space the items evenly within the container.

4. Allow the items to wrap onto multiple lines if needed.

5. Make the flex items responsive using Bootstrap's grid system.

6. Then check the final output if it was responsive. Take a screenshot of your reading list activity and put it under academic-break-readinglist folder right beside your frontend folder. Have an ARL-1 folder inside it, then paste your screenshot inside. Thank you!
