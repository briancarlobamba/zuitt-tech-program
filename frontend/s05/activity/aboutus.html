		<p>Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated, also known as Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc. or Doofenshmirtz Corporation, is a company owned by the evil scientist Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz. Most of the daily operations of the company are run by Doofenshmirtz himself. The main purpose of the company is to assist Dr. Doofenshmirtz in his schemes to conquer the Tri-State Area.</p>

		A typical day at Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated begins with Dr. Doofenshmirtz coming up with a plan to take over the Tri-State Area. He then builds an evil invention, also known as an "Inator". Perry the Platypus, Doofenshmirtz's nemesis, arrives to put a stop to the scheme. Doofenshmirtz captures Perry in a trap, and explains his evil plan. After Dr. Doofenshmirtz is finished explaining, Perry escapes from the trap and defeats Doofenshmirtz. Job done, Perry leaves Doofenshmirtz to shout "Curse you, Perry the Platypus!". The building can be seen from some of the suburban areas of Danville, such as Phineas and Ferb's backyard.

		<p><strong>Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz</strong></p>
		<p>Heinz Doofenshmirtz, also known as Dr. Doofenshmirtz, Doof, Dr. D, Slouchy (by Rodney), Heinz the Ocelot (in "O.W.C.A. Files"), and Professor Time (in Milo Murphy's Law), is a 47 year old evil scientist hailing from the country of Drusselstein. The head of Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated, he tends not to be evil in the traditional sense, but rather overly dramatic, eccentric and generally clueless. His usual lair is an office building that he apparently owns, though he has worked from other locations when necessary for his plans.</p>

		<p>Vanessa Doofenshmirtz is the daughter of Heinz and Charlene Doofenshmirtz.Vanessa is sharp, wise, and sarcastic. Her behavior is comparable to that of a typical teenager. She cares about her reputation, having been upset when her clothes were mistakenly switched with Candace's. Vanessa has always been found with the "punk" or "goth" crowd, as seen in her childhood photos and her friends' appearances ("Hail Doofania!", "Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together", "Brain Drain").</p>
