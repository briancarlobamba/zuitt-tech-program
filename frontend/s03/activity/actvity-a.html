	<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> code of ethics, professional responsibility, software engineering</p><br>

	<p><strong>ABSTRACT:</strong> <em>The Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice,intended as a standard for teaching and practicing software engineering, documentsthe ethical and professional obligations of software engineers. The code shouldinstruct practitioners about the standards society expects them to meet, about whattheir peers strive for, and about what to expect of one another. In addition, the codeshould also inform the public about the responsibilities that are important to theprofession.</em></p>

	<p><em>Adopted in 2000 by the IEEE Computer Society and the ACM—two leadinginternational computing societies—the code of ethics is intended as a guide formembers of the evolving software engineering profession. The code was developed by amultinational task force with additional input from other professionals from industry,government posts, military installations, and educational professionsAdopted in 2000 by the IEEE Computer Society and the ACM—two leadinginternational computing societies—the code of ethics is intended as a guide formembers of the evolving software engineering profession. The code was developed by amultinational task force with additional input from other professionals from industry,government posts, military installations, and educational professions.</em></p><br>

	<p><strong>PREAMBLE</strong><br><br>

	The short version of the code summarizes aspirations at a high level of abstraction. Theclauses that are included in the full version give examples and details of how theseaspirations change the way we act as software engineering professionals. Without theaspirations, the details can become legalistic and tedious; without the details, theaspirations can become high-sounding but empty; together, the aspirations and thedetails form a cohesive code. <br><br> Software engineers shall commit themselves to making the analysis, specification,design, development, testing, and maintenance of software a beneficial and respectedprofession. In accordance with their commitment to the health, safety, and welfare ofthe public, software engineers shall adhere to the following eight Principles:<br><br>
	<strong>PRINCIPLES</strong>

	<ol>
		<li><em>Public.</em>  Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.</li>
		<li><em>Client and employer.</em> Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the bestinterests of their client and employer, consistent with the public interest.</li>
		<li><em>Product.</em> Software engineers shall ensure that their products and relatedmodifications meet the highest professional standards possible.4. Judgment. Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in theirprofessional judgment</li>
		<li><em>Management.</em> Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to andpromote an ethical approach to the management of software development andmaintenance.</li>
		<li><em>Profession.</em> Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of theprofession consistent with the public interest</li>
		<li><em>Colleagues.</em> Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.</li>
		<li><em>Self.</em> Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practiceof their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of theprofession.</li>
	</ol>
