			<h3 align="center"><em>Hooks and pulls enemies towards him.</em></h3>
			<p align="center">Each carefully aimed throw of Pudge's signature <strong>Meat Hook</strong> strikes fear into his foes. Disoriented, his foe stumbles, gagging on a sudden stench of <strong>Rot</strong>. As it looks up at the fleshy hulk, hoping for an answer, only to watch as the Butcher <strong>Dismembers</strong> and carves them with his cleavers, adding a layer to his compost <strong>Heap</strong>. With every kill he gains additional health and damage, and soon becomes an unstoppable behemoth of rotting flesh.</p>

			<p>	In the Fields of Endless Carnage, far to the south of Quoidge, a corpulent figure works tirelessly through the night--dismembering, disembowelling, piling up the limbs and viscera of the fallen that the battlefield might be clear by dawn. In this cursed realm, nothing can decay or decompose; no corpse may ever return to the earth from which it sprang, no matter how deep you dig the grave. Flocked by carrion birds who need him to cut their meals into beak-sized chunks, Pudge the Butcher hones his skills with blades that grow sharper the longer he uses them. Swish, swish, thunk. Flesh falls from the bone; tendons and ligaments part like wet paper. And while he always had a taste for the butchery, over the ages, Pudge has developed a taste for its byproduct as well. Starting with a gobbet of muscle here, a sip of blood there...before long he was thrusting his jaws deep into the toughest of torsos, like a dog gnawing at rags. Even those who are beyond fearing the Reaper, fear the Butcher.</p>
